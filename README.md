discord bot

README
main.sqlite and mainsqlite are just the databases used to store information on how much "money" is in the user's "wallet" and "bank"
i plan to add more to this bot such as depositing wallet value into bank and adding more ways to earn money and obviously more jojo references
i did not have enough time to implement these features as i took a while to get my bot up to date with discord.py 2.0 as i reused code from an old bot that i made last year
as mentioned in the file itself, client.run() is empty as it is supposed to contain the token to my bot and since this is a public repository, i do not want the token to be shown here
